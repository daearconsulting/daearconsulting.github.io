Sovereignty-Aligned Data Infrastructure | Tribal Data Sovereignty | Geospatial Analytics | AI-Integrated Governance

We build practical, governance-aware data systems for Tribal Nations and mission-driven organizations. Unlike most firms that focus on policy or standards, we turn governance principles into operational pipelines that embed consent, stewardship, and community control directly into technical workflows.

### Our Core Expertise
- **Tribal Data Sovereignty Implementation** – Respecting community governance in every system  
- **Geospatial & Remote Sensing Analytics** – Land-based data systems and spatial intelligence  
- **AI/ML Integration** – Machine learning pipelines built with governance in mind  
- **Cloud & HPC Infrastructure** – Scalable, reproducible, and secure systems  
- **Governance-Aware Metadata** – Aligned with OCAP®, CARE, FAIR, IEEEP2890/D1 and community-defined protocols  

**We operate at the intersection of technical excellence and ethical data stewardship.**
